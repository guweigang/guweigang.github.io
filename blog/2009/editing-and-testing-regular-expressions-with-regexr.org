[[http://gskinner.com/RegExr/][RegExr]] is an *online tool for editing and testing Regular Expressions* (RegExp / RegEx). It provides a simple interface to enter RegEx expressions, and visualize matches in real-time editable source text. It also provides a handy RegExp snippet sidebar with descriptions and usage examples to make it easier to learn Regular Expressions through trial and error.

[[http://gskinner.com/RegExr/][RegExr]] is built with Flex 3, and uses ActionScript 3's built in RegExp engine. It isn't as powerful as a product like RegExBuddy, but it has the advantage of being online and free. You are able to save your patterns locally, and to share patterns on a searchable community database of regular expressions as well.
